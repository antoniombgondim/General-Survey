# Analyzing Categorical Data 

In this project, we'll be working with categorical data and will be using a subset of data from the following data set: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/norc/general-social-survey?select=gss.csv).
After cleaning the data, we will use some visualizations tools. We also had used statsmodels for a special type of categorical plot.
Afterwards, we will predict the labor_status column using random forest classifier and feature selection, and PCA dimensionality reduction and than SVM classifier. Lastly we compare the accuracy tests of both models
